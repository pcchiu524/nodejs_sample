      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/cc2541dk-sensor" target="_blank">Texas Instruments Sensor Tag</a> 
        is meant to help developers begin working with Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)
        devices.  Bluetooth LE allows devices to communicate without having to complete the pairing step which
        is normally required when using Bluetooth.  Bluetooth LE is ideal for retrieving data from sensors that are showing up
        in more and more devices in our homes and on our person.  While the Sensor Tag has some practical uses, it
        is really meant to help developers learn how to build apps using these technologies.
      </p>
      <h2>The How</h2>
      <p>
        The demo apps included in this site are meant to show you have to leverage the data produced from the Sensor Tag.
        However the first step in leveraging the data is retrieving the data from the Sensor Tage itself.  There are
        various ways of doing this but they all involve using Bluetooth LE, so the first thing you need is a Bluetooth LE
        enabled device that is connected to the internet.  This could be your computer, mobile phone, tablet, Raspberry PI, 
        or Beaglebone Black.  Most newer computers, tablets, and mobile phones should be able to talk Bluetooth LE.  If you
        are using a Raspberry PI or Beaglebone Black you will need a Bluetooth LE USB adapter.
      </p>

      <h2>Connect To The Sensor Tag</h2>
      <h3>Beagle Bone Black</h3>
      <p>
        I chose to use a <href="http://beagleboard.org/black">Beaglebone Black Rev C</a> to connect to my Sensor Tag.
        I was able to connect the Sensor Tag to the Beaglebone Black with <a href="http://plugable.com/products/usb-bt4le">this</a> 
        Bluetooth LE USB adaptor.  Both are pretty cheap, the two combined cost $70.
      </p>

      <h3>Raspberry PI</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to use a Rasberry PI, there are plenty of 
        <a href="http://mike.saunby.net/2013/04/raspberry-pi-and-ti-cc2541-sensortag.html">articles</a> out there describing 
        how.  
      </p>

      <h3>Using Bluetooth LE</h3>
      <p>
        Before being able to connect the Sensor Tag to the Beaglebone you will need to install some software.  SSH
        into the Beaglebone by running <b>ssh root@192.168.7.2</b> and run the following commands.
        <pre>
$ apt-get install bluez
$ apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
        </pre>
      </p>

      <h3>OS X</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to use OSX to connect to the Sensor Tag you need to run one command in a Terminal window.
        <pre>
$ sudo nvram bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior="never"
        </pre>
        You will need to restart your Mac after running this command.
      </p>
      <h2>The Code</h2>
      <p>
        After you have your device, you need to connect to the Sensor Tag.  How you do this depends on the device you 
        are using.  If you plan on using a mobile phone or tablet, TI has provided some sample code for iOS and Android
        that should help you out.  If you are going to connect to the device from a computer, a light weight programming
        language like Node.js is usually a good idea, especially if you are connecting to a Raspberry PI or BeagleBone Black.
      </p>

      <p>
        After your device is able to access the data from the Sensor Tag you are probably going to want to publish the data somewhere
        so your apps can access it.  Luckily there is a standard protocol for sharing data of this type.  It is called 
        <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a>.  MQTT is a lightweight, machine-to-machine connectivity protocol, and functions
        much like other pub-sub protocols.  IBM has provided an MQTT server we can use as part of its 
        <a href="https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/">Internet of Things Cloud (IoT)</a>.  
        Connecting to it is easy using any MQTT library.  For details on how to connect to the IBM IoT cloud
        you can follow these <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/iot/recipes/improvise-registered-devices/">instructions</a>.

      <p>
        In my case I chose to use Node.js on my Beaglebone Black.  There is a 
        <a href="https://github.com/sandeepmistry/node-sensortag">Node.js library</a> that makes connecting to
        and retrieving data from the Sensor Tag really easy.  There is also an 
        <a href="https://github.com/adamvr/MQTT.js/">MQTT library</a> that we can use to connect to 
        the IBM IoT Cloud.  The code to connect to the Sensort Tag and publish to the IoT cloud can be found in
        this GitHub repo.  You can clone the repo by running the following command on your Beaglebone Black.

        <pre>
$  git clone 
        </pre>

        Before you run the code you will need to register the application in the IoT Cloud.  To do this you need to
        register for the <a href="https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/">beta</a>.  After you sign up you can
        register a device, all you need is the MAC address.  The result of registering the device will give you some
        properties you will need to connect to the IoT cloud.  The properties will look something like this.

        <pre>
org=someorg
type=atype
id=macaddress
auth-method=token
auth-token=secrettoken
        </pre>

        The Sensor Tag code will read these properties from a properties file.  Create a new file called config.properties 
        in the publish directory and copy the properties into the file and save it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you run this code, by running node sensor-tag.js, you will see the Mac address of the computer you are running
        on printed to the console and then a message indicating the program is waiting for a connection from a 
        Sensor Tag.  If you press the button on the side of your Sensor Tag to turn it on you should see the program indicate it has
        found the Sensor Tag and print out some basic properties about it.  Once you see that, data should be published
        to the IoT Cloud.  
      </p>
      <p>
        To quickly see the data being published you can head over to Bluemix and create a Node-RED instance connected to the IoT
        Cloud.  Instructions on how to do this can be found 
        <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/iot/recipes/node-red-registered-application/">here</a>.  Once you have the Node-RED app up
        and running should be able to see all the data coming from your Sensor Tag in the debug tab.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Node-RED flow prints out all topics published from the MAC address, however if you look closely at the Node
        code you will notice that we are actually publishing a bunch of different topics allowing applications to consume
        only the data they want.  Below is a table describing the topics published and what topics you can subscribe to in
        order to listen for specific data from the Sensor Tag.

        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Publish Topic</th>
              <th>Subscription Topic</th>
              <th>Values</th>
              <th>Frequency</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
